# Intro to Creative Code

VIS 42, Fall 2025 at UC San Diego

| [Schedule](#topics-and-schedule) | [Description](#description) | [Resources](#resources) | [Grading](#grading) | [Policies](#policies) | [References](#references) |

## Description

This course provides students with a foundation in programming and computational thinking, and their application in creative projects. Topics covered may include generative graphics and sound, interactive media, and others. Students will gain practical skills through hands-on experience and experimentation, learning to integrate computing into artistic practices. No prior programming experience is required.

### Description

- Instructor: Dr. Robert Twomey
- Class: Tu/Th 9:30-10:50 AM
- Location: TBD
- Office Hours:
   - in person: TBD (Envision)
   - online: TBD (zoom)

**Prerequisites**: None

**Restrictions** students who have received credit for any of CSE 8A, 8B, 11, 6R, COGS 18, BILD 62, DSC20 (or equivalents) may not enroll for credit in this course.

## Tools
We will use the open source creative coding language p5.js ([link](https://p5js.org/)) within a jupyterlite environment. Try it out [here](https://p5nb.vercel.app/tree/index.html)!

## Resources
**Canvas**: used for everything. Daily announcements, links to lectures, assignments, discussions
**Zoom**: used for office hours, individual meetings
**Google Drive**: used for lectures, surveys, etc. See Canvas for link
**Discord**: informal discussion, questions, peer support. See Canvas for link

## Required Materials
You will need access to a laptop or other computer. I recommend a notebook specifically for taking notes, drawing ideas, “writing” code, etc.

## Course Format
- Plan to spend ~9 hours outside of class on coursework each week. (4 credit course ~ 12 hours of work time)
   - Labs -  ~1-2 hour
   - Projects -  ~3-5 hours
   - Reflection, peer reviews - .5 hour
- Each week, you will have a lab, a project, and some weeks you will have peer reviews.
   - Labs are due before Thursday’s class.
   - Projects are due Monday night at midnight.
   - Peer reviews are due before Thursday’s class (you have from Tuesday morning - Thursday before class)
- Late work will be penalized. See Late Work policy below.
- The emphasis of this class is on regular, weekly coding practice, self-expression, reflection, and peer community/support.

## Educational Objectives
At the end of the course, students will be able to:
- Read and write code with p5.js
  - Demonstrated through effective use of the p5.js language in exercises and assignments
- Understand key programming concepts
  - Functions, variables, operators, conditionals, loops, arrays
- Create digital artworks using emerging technologies, informed by precedents from the history of art and technology.
- Describe work and document process. 
  - Demonstrated through descriptions and reflections on exercises and peer reviews.
- Demonstrate efficacy in computational thinking core components (see computational thinking)
  - Decomposition, pattern recognition, abstraction, algorithmic thinking, generalization, evaluation
- Structure projects, name files, comment code, document outputs, and submit assignments according to professional and ICAM standards.

# Policies

Course-specific policies and rules.

| [ICAM Policies](#icam-policies) | [Attendance](#attendance) | [Late Work](#late-work) | [Academic Integrity](#academic-integrity) | [Other People's Code](#other-peoples-code) | [UCSD Course Policies](#ucsd-course-policies) |

## ICAM Policies
File naming conventions and submissions. More [TK].

## Attendance
On-time attendance is required as well as work inside and outside of section. Please notify your instructor in advance if you must be absent for illness or family emergency. Any absences must be cleared with the instructor, or justified with written documentation (e.g. letter from team, etc.). We do not differentiate between mental and physical health and in either case please be in communication for when you need to take a day off. **After a student misses a week’s worth of classes each subsequent missed class will result in the reduction of the final grade by a full letter grade (i.e., A to B, B- to C-).** Excessive tardiness or leaving early will also impact your grade and will follow the same rubric.

On-time attendance is required. Lateness or leaving early, when not cleared with the instructor, will also impact your participation grade. Lateness will be counted as 80% for your participation grade for the day.

## Late Work 
**Late Work Grading Policy**. Late work will be docked 5% for each day they are late (if an assignment is two days late, the grade will be docked 10%). An assignment submitted after the due date time on the due date will still be docked 5%. The lowest possible grade for late work is 60%, which means that for an assignment submitted more than 8 days late, no more than 40% will be docked, but the maximum grade you will receive is 60%. Details about submission format and due date are given in Canvas. 

**Excused Late Work**. Requests to submit late work for special circumstances must be approved by your instructor at least 24 hours before the due date and time. Any late requests made less than 24 hours before the assignment is due may still be subject to a lateness penalty. We do not distinguish between mental and physical health. **Email your instructor, 24 hours in advance, explaining generally the reason you are missing class and your plans for making up any missed lecture, activity, and assignment**. 

An assignment may receive an F if a student does not participate in every phase of the development of the project and meet all deadlines for preliminary materials (proposals, drafts, etc.).  Failure to submit any of the graded course assignments is grounds for failure in the course.  

## Academic Integrity
Integrity of scholarship is essential for an academic community. The University expects that both faculty and students will honor this principle and in so doing protect the validity of University intellectual work. For students, this means that all academic work will be done by the individual to whom it is assigned, without unauthorized aid of any kind.

## Other People’s Code
**If you use a piece of code from the p5 reference or another piece of publicly available code, you must cite your use of it at the top of your code file as a comment**. Include a link to the original code file, the author, and the date.

## Land Acknowledgment
This public acknowledgment serves to honor and respect Indigenous peoples and their land on which our campus resides. UC San Diego was built upon the territory of the Kumeyaay Nation. From time immemorial, the Kumeyaay people have been a part of this land. Today, the Kumeyaay people continue to maintain their political sovereignty and cultural traditions as vital members of the San Diego community.
